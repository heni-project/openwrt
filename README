This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution for HENI's CherryMote.

=========== Preparing work environment and building image ============

*Caution, the openwrt directory easily grows to 7-8GB*

1. Clone HENI openwrt fork from GitHub

$ git clone https://github.com/heni-project/openwrt.git -b cherrymote
$ cd openwrt/

2. Add HENI package feed

$ echo "src-link heni </absolute/path/to/heni/repo>/software/supervisor/openwrt-feed" >> feeds.conf.default

3. Update package definitions and install symlinks

$ ./scripts/feeds update -a
$ ./scripts/feeds install -a

You might need dependencies:

$ sudo apt install gawk zlib1g libncurses5 g++ flex protobuf-c-compiler mercurial subversion libncurses5-dev libssl-dev

4. Check if our changes to `.config` are overwritten by update, e.g.:

$ git diff | grep watchdog-client

If so, restore previous version from repository:

$ git checkout .config

5. Build image

$ make

First build involves preparing cross-compiler and other tools and is quite
lengthy. Subsequent builds should take no more than a few minutes.
This should create the image in build_dir/target-mipsel_24kec+dsp_uClibc-0.9.33.2/linux-ramips_rt305x/openwrt-ramips-rt305x-olinuxino-rt5350f-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin

6. Upload image to the device

Using heni-cli, e.g.:

$ heni supervisor update -d dev:node0 ./image.bin
